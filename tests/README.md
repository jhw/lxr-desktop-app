# Host unit tests

These tests compile firmware source files with your computer's own C compiler (Clang or GCC)
and run them on the computer, so they need no LXR, debug probe or Arm toolchain. They use
AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, so an out-of-bounds access or undefined
behaviour in the code under test also fails the test.

## Running

From the repository root:

```sh
cmake --preset host-tests
cmake --build --preset host-tests
ctest --preset host-tests
```

You need CMake, Ninja and a C compiler: on macOS the Xcode Command Line Tools, on Linux e.g.
`sudo apt install build-essential`. MSVC isn't supported; on Windows use WSL or MSYS2.
Set `-DLXR_TEST_SANITIZERS=OFF` when configuring if your compiler has no sanitizers.

The tests are a separate CMake project (see `LXR_HOST_TESTS` in the top-level
`CMakeLists.txt`), so they don't change the firmware build. They are built in `build/host-tests/`.
GitHub Actions runs them, and builds the firmware, for every push and pull request
(`.github/workflows/build.yml`).

## How it works

| Folder / file | Contents |
|---|---|
| `shim/` | Stand-ins for `stm32f7xx_hal.h` and `stm32f7xx.h`: integer types, CMSIS intrinsics (`__CLZ`, `__SSAT`, `__QADD16`, ...) in portable C, and opaque HAL handle types. It comes first on the include path, so the firmware headers are used unchanged. |
| `framework/lxr_test.h` | `CHECK`, `CHECK_EQ`, `CHECK_MEM_EQ`, `RUN_TEST`, `TEST_REPORT`. A failed check prints the file, line and both values, then the test carries on. |
| `test_*.c` | One test program each. |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | `lxr_add_host_test()` builds a test program from its test file and the firmware files it tests, and registers it with CTest. |

The compiler defines `LXR_HOST_TEST`. The firmware uses it only to leave out the
`.itcm_text`/`.dtcm` section attributes (`Core/Inc/Soundengine/config.h`, `Core/Inc/main.h`),
which don't exist on the host.

## Adding a test

1. Write `tests/test_<name>.c` with `static void test_...(void)` functions and a `main()` that
   calls `RUN_TEST()` for each and returns `TEST_REPORT()`.
2. Add it to `tests/CMakeLists.txt`:

   ```cmake
   lxr_add_host_test(test_<name>
       SOURCES test_<name>.c
       FIRMWARE_SOURCES Core/Src/<file under test>.c
   )
   ```

3. If the linker reports missing functions or variables, the firmware file calls into code that
   isn't part of the test. Define them in the test file as simple stubs that record what was
   called. If the compiler reports a missing HAL type or intrinsic, add it to `shim/`.

Keep the firmware files themselves unchanged for testing. If a file is hard to test because it
mixes logic with hardware access, the better fix is to move the logic into its own function or
file, so that the firmware and the test share it.
